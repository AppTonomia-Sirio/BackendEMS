# Authentication
To use the majority of the API endpoints, you need to be authenticated.
## Sign Up
### Signing up as an NNA
Let's create a new NNA user. To do that, we need to send a `POST` request to `/users/nna/` with the following data:
```json
{
    "email": "...",
    "name": "...",	
    "surname": "...",
    "password": "...",
    "document": "...",
    "date_of_birth": "...",
    "home": "...",
    "gender": "...",
    "description": "..."
}
```
The `description` field is a string containing the description of the user.

The `gender` field is the gender of the NNA, it can take the following values `{Male, Female, Other, Undefined}` default is `Undefined`. It is optional.

The `home` field is the ID of the home the user is going to be assigned to.

The `date_of_birth` field is a string in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.

The `document` field is a string containing the document number of the user.

The `password` field is a string containing the password of the user.

The `email` field is a string containing the email of the user.

The `name` field is a string containing the name of the user. 

The `surname` field is a string containing the surname of the user.

The response will be:
```json
{
    "id": "...",
    "email": "...",
    "name": "...",
    "surname": "...",

    "educators": [],
    "main_educator": null,

    "is_autonomy_tutor": "...", 
    "description":"...",
    "autonomy_tutor": null,
    "entered_at": null
}
```
### Signing up as a Staff user
Let's create a new Staff user. To do that, we need to send a `POST` request to `/users/staff/` with the following data:

{
    "email": "...",
    "name": "...",	
    "surname": "...",
    "password": "...",
    "homes":["..."],
    "roles":["..."],
    "is_staff":"..."
}
```
The `is_staff` field is a boolean determining the admin status of the user.

The `roles` field is an array of the IDs of the roles this user is going to be assigned to.

The `homes` field is an array of the IDs of the homes the user is going to be assigned to.

The response will be:

    "id": "...",
    "email": "...",
    "name": "...",
    "surname": "...",
    "created_at": "...",
    "homes":["..."],
    "roles":["..."],
    "is_staff":"..."
}
```
## Logging in
To log in, we need to send a `POST` request to `/users/login/` with the following data:

```
[
    "Authorization": "Token <token>"
]
```
